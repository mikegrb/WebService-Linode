    - fix primary keys marked as required param for domain_resource_create and
      linode_config_create (thanks Peter Stephan)
      - note: not fixed upstream yet gen-validation.pl output can not be used
        directly currently

0.10 2012-20-08
    - updated API definition from api.spec after Linode fix, closes #79093

0.09 2012-29-07
    - Forgot to bump version number in DNS.pm and Base.pm
        this is why all my other modules use Dist::Zilla

0.08 2012-29-07
    - new upstream API calls added
        many additions including nodebalancer support
        see for full changes http://j.mp/MNKKTf
    - patch from stephon for deprecated DNS.pm (closes rt #71833)

0.07 2012-10-02
    - Correct typo in resourceid argument to domain_resource->list

0.06 1012-12-01
    - Correct reference to module name in docs (closes rt #59535 reported
      by Paul Hansen)
    - Use direct object notation rather than indirect notation
    - new upstream API calls added

0.05 2009-09-14
    - Apikey is no longer a required argument to the base constructor
    - New method in the base class, apikey for specifying or changing apikey
      at times other than construction
    - New method in WebService::Linode, user_getapikey, given a valid Linode
      username and password, returns $data->{api_key}.  Note: you are
      currently still responsible for calling $api->apikey($key) after
      retrieving the key if you wish to use it for subsequent requests.
    - fix WebService::Linode::DNS domainResourceGet when called with domain
      name rather than id. (closes #49452 reported by jtmink1)

0.04 2009-08-10 21:45:49 EDT
    - Update to Linode.com API version 2.0 -- This is a pretty big change,
      includes support for Linodes now as well as DNS
    - WebService::Linode::DNS is now deprecated but /should/ continue to work.
      changing to WebService::Linode should be straight forward with a few
      method names changed to match the Linode.com methods with dots replaced
      with under scores.

      IO::Socket::SSL instead in the README
