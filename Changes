0.05  Mon Sep 14 2009
    - Apikey is no longer a required argument to the base constructor
    - New method in the base class, apikey for specifying or changing apikey
      at times other than construction
    - New method in WebService::Linode, user_getapikey, given a valid Linode
      username and password, returns $data->{api_key}.  Note: you are
      currently still responsible for calling $api->apikey($key) after
      retrieving the key if you wish to use it for subsequent requests.
    - fix WebService::Linode::DNS domainResourceGet when called with domain
      name rather than id. (closes #49452 reported by jtmink1)

0.04  Mon Aug 10 21:45:49 EDT 2009
    - Update to Linode.com API version 2.0 -- This is a pretty big change,
      includes support for Linodes now as well as DNS
    - WebService::Linode::DNS is now deprecated but /should/ continue to work.
      changing to WebService::Linode should be straight forward with a few
      method names changed to match the Linode.com methods with dots replaced
      with under scores.
